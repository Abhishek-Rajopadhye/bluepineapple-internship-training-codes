            if no lifts
                already optimized, use the stairs bro
            if lift already on floor address the floor
            if lift is idle send lifts to equidistant floors.
                one on ground, one on top. If only one lift, send to ground. others equidistant from each other
            for lift moving up, address lower floors, and up direction
                group close floor together and in same direction(eg group floors 3, 5, and 8 with direction up with first stop at 3)(close = +-5, may need to change with floor quantity)
                if capacity filled move until first destination and people loaded off
            for lift moving down address upper floors, and down direction
                group close floor together and in same direction(eg group floors 31, 35, and 36 with direction down with first stop at 36)(close = +-5, may need to change with floor quantity)
                if capacity filled move until first destination and people loaded off
            if lift near ground floor address floors upper to lift or up direction first.
            if lift near top floor address floors lower to lift or down direction first.
            if lift near middle address group with most number first.
